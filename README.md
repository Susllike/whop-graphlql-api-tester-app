1. Install dependencies with: `pnpm i`

2. Create a Whop App on your [whop developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/), then go to the "Hosting" section and:
	- Ensure the "Base URL" is set to the domain you intend to deploy the site on.
	- Ensure the "App path" is set to `/experiences/[experienceId]`
	- Ensure the "Dashboard path" is set to `/dashboard/[companyId]`

3. Copy the environment variables from the `.env.development` into a `.env.local`. Ensure to use real values from the whop dashboard.

4. Go to a whop created in the same org as the app you created. Navigate to the tools section and add your app.
